# Welcome
I am Jonas, a software developer with a passion.

## Education
2012-2017: Master of Computer Science, Ghent University, Belgium
<br>
[Master Thesis](thesis): JIT-ROP attack against a MVEE

------

## Career
2017-Present: Technical consultant (Electronics and Embedded Systems) @ Altran

### Clients
* Barco (2017-2018):
  Python control framework for a media gateway.
  The software, running on a customized Debian, is a RTSP server
  that receives stream requests from decoders,
  and starts gstreamer pipelines to handle the media streams.
  It makes heavy use of object orientation, asyncio,
  subprocess handling and custom decorators.

* PsiControl(2019-2020):
  Bare-metal software development in C/C++.
  Various types of projects, mostly with ARM based MCUs (STM32 and NRF52):
  - small M0 devices for motor and valve control
  - fast, feature rich STM32H7 boards with touchscreen and external flash
  - with or without RTOS (FreeRTOS)
  - communication over I2C, CAN, UART, SPI, BLE, ...

### Internal
- Python trainer (2019-2020)

------

## Smaller projects (personal, university and professional)
* 3D gripper arm to play 4-on-a-row
* Visual SLAM with a simple 3 wheeled robot
* Autonomous person recognition with drone & Qt GUI interface

* Backend development with .NET core & SQL server database (hosted in Azure)
* Frontend development with [Blazor](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/blazor) WebAssembly (hosted in Azure)
* Graphical application development with Windows Forms

* Several Rust projects

## Interests
Lately I've been interested in the "maker"-scene, mostly in 3D printing, CNC machines,
laser cutters and the accompanying skills like CAD design.
There's something very enticing about making something that's both unique and useful.

Other interests and areas of passion are:
* Mechanical keyboard design: there are several communities of keyboard enthusiasts online,
  which have existed for many years already, but have seen an increase in interest lately.
  Here people discuss anything keyboard related: layout, aesthetics, ergonomics, different switches, mounting styles, ...
  Designers create new high-end keyboards or keycaps and may then launch a 'group-buy' for the community to participate in.
* PCB design: something my education didn't really touch upon,
  so I'm trying to learn the basics on my own, mostly in function of designing my own keyboard.
* [Zephyr RTOS](https://zephyrproject.org/): a relatively new, but interesting RTOS that is backed
  by a lot of big companies (Google, Intel, NXP, Nordic, ...).
* Rust: a systems programming language that takes the good things from some other languages
  and puts them together in a well-designed manner. Coming back to C/C++ is always a bit hard after writing some Rust ;)
